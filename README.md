# Hestia

## Overview

Hestia (from the Greek goddess of the family and home) is a Python-based web application that develops a house valuation index to allow people to value and sell their own houses in Belfast.

## Technology stack

The Python web application uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as the backend framework and [Angular](https://angular.io/) as the frontend framework. Documentation of the RESTful API service is handled by [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). Development is done within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and we use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as our main database.

## Building the application

We use Docker in the development of Hestia to make it easy to build, run and share. We have two Dockerfile's: one the builds the Python backend and one that builds the Angular GUI. Both components of the application can be built from the `build.sh` file:
```
git clone https://github.com/O1sims/Hestia.git
cd Hestia
bash build.sh all
```
The `build.sh` file has multiple options to choose from.

## Running the application

The `build.sh` file also coordinates the running of the application. Specifically, the application can be run with the following command:
```
bash build.sh up
```
Likewise, the application can be brought down with `bash build.sh down`.

By default, the main Hestia application is accessible on port `3000`, the API and backend components are on port `5000`, the Mongo database is run on port `8210`. The `docker-compose.yml` can be altered to allow these services to run on different ports. Swagger API documentation can be found at `localhost:5000/swagger/`.

Environmental variables for the application can be changed in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Using the application

The application stores data of 1,500 properties which have been scraped from NI's biggest property portal, PropertyPal. When the application is initially ran, a property valuation model is created and stored. This is used to value properties in Belfast and is at the crux of the application.

Using your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`, here you will see a front page with a search bar. You can search for whatever you like... but since there are only 1,500 properties, you may want to use the search term, `holywood` or `east belfast` or just `belfast` to get a list of properties. Each property should have some analysis that suggests whether it is overvalued, undervalued or correctly priced.

Along with search, a user can also analyse the price estimation of their own properties and upload details of their property to the database. It will then be searchable.

To get an overview of the backend, please look at the Swagger documentation `localhost:5000/swagger/` and have a play there!
